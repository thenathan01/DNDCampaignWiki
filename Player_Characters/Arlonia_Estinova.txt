== Personality ==
Arlonia cares little for the safety of others, which is likely due to his understanding of the universality of death. He wants nothing more than to have fun and feel the rush of taking the lives of others while his heart is still beating. He can be sadistic at times, and is inclined to indulge in physical desires.

"Nothing important, killed a a lot, saved a lot, doesn't matter in the end. Was in the Obsidian Citadel Army Corps for awhile. Got bored though as the war ended and I needed the rush of life and death."
