====== Active Notes ======
===== Planning Next Session (ongoing thoughts) =====

* Back to Dawn's Rest: have something ready to be happening in town
	* 'Old Salt' will be ready to offer advice of the island and which direction to head next
		* If pressed enough, we will be ready to lead them to the old Fishermen's Guild headquarters, where some shipping and fishing supplies still remain.
	* Kalli has returned to her family's farm
* Thinking about consequences of what the party did in the goblin cave
	* __Vexian will fly back to the E.O outpost and notify the Order that some adventurers cleared out the cave__, killing all the goblins and dismantling the entirety of the port.
		* The E.O will surely begin to track the adventurers from a distance, ensuring they don't come too close to the mountain.
	* __Elandra will be wondering where her shipments are,__ as they are crucial to her business.
		* She will probably start looking to outsource her supply to someone else in Elderwood that may be able to aid her.
	
* __PAGES TO FINISH__
	* Dawn's Edge 
	* Elderwood City
	* The Elderwoods
	* Storm Crags
	* Elandra the Herbalist
	* Vespera
	* Kalli?
	* River Crossings?

===== Threads to Follow/Consequences =====
* Party dismantled the Eclipsed Order's smuggling operation overseen by Vexian, and will likely have wizards out searching for them.
* Elandra sends hired hands to investigate her missing shipments
* The bandit who escaped from the old Fisherman's Guild will tell his story, and retell Crell's healing of the two bandits
* The telepathic girl, Kalli, has returned to her families farm near Sunhollow. The party might find the building razed, or the parents slaughtered in some extreme way with the girl having been taken again (E.O responsible) 
* Sunblossom Petals and Infernal Ash from the cave could have value to Elandra and E.O, respectively.

===== Q's to Consider =====
* How to more effectively inflict consequences? I don't want to kill them off since it's our first campaign, but I also don't want them to be plot-proof. Consequences are necessary for dimension of the world

===== Q's for Players =====
=== Arlonia Estinova ===
* On the Isle of Vespera one of the prominent governing forces is called the Azura's Rest Guard, and it is a contracted division of the Obsidian Citadel Army Corps. Was Arlonia familiar with the 'Azura's Rest Guard' during his time in Obsidian Citadel Army Corps? Did he ever know anyone assigned to the ARG or hear anything about them? or did he ever venture around Azura's Rest? 
* Any connections still from the OCAC? Are there any other soldiers or leaders who would remember Arlonia/want to keep in touch with him? How notorious is the 'Obsidian Killer' blade?
* Any memories of what happened in the war? Any significant memories or places visited? â€“ this one is way more general, if you don't have any ideas I am going to make up what the war was but it probably won't be relevant for a while. 
* Any other fun character notes you want to throw in or to come into the campaign at some point

=== Big Chungus ===
* How is Big Chungus' relationship with Big Daddy Gram? 
* What does Chungus remember from the NLA and what did he do while he was raised within the organization?
* Why did he leave at the age of 15 to pursue solo endeavors?
* Does he remember anything about his real parents or the incident that led to him being an orphan?
* Any other fun character notes you want to throw in or to come into the campaign at some point


=== Crell ===
* Order of the Sacred Cow: what is it? how many worshippers? do they have an official headquarters somewhere? Is the recognition of the order widespread or is it more of a hidden sect type of thing?
* In one of our last sessions it was revealed to us that Crell does not actually care that much about the protection/well-being of cattle, but is actually more concerned with his apparent milk addiction? Has he always been this way, or were his intentions in the Order once more pure? Do you see him as a sort of faux-priest or do you think he has a genuine soft-spot for cattle and the farming community?
* Any other fun character notes you want to throw in or to come into the campaign at some point
