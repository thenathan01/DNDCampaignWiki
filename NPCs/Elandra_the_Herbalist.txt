====== Elandra the Herbalist ======
==== Background ====
Elandra is part wood-elf, and well accustomed to the ins and outs of the Elderwoods. She was an orphaned child, found by the residents of the Elderwood City when a logging expedition led them past the outer rim of the forest. Taken in by local residents, she was raised as one of their own, and her loyalties remain nearly exclusively to those of Elderwood City. She sees her life as one of service to the community, and she never pursues a cause that isn't for a greater good.

==== Residence ====
Elandra is well established in Elderwood City, with her own residence that doubles as her alchemy lab, and triples as the local clinic.

==== Personality ====
* Guarded - while warm and loving with those she knows well, and caring for her community, she is not quick to welcome or trust outsiders.
* Altruistic - she believes that all of her actions must serve a greater cause. While occasionally sacrificing her individual morals (such as when working with the Eclipsed Order), it is always in the name of a greater good.
* Scrappy - she is quick to whip up a potion, topical ointment, or even a trap depending on the scenario. 
* Homebody - she is not fond of leaving Elderwood City, and is almost never seen far from the forest. for this reason, she relies on contracting the Eclipsed Order for shipments that come from far away, and contracting local 'talent' when a situation arises that requires a strong hand.

==== Skills ====
* Alchemy - Elandra has spent her whole life venturing throughout the Elderwoods and becoming familiar with the ingredients provided by the forest, all of which have properties taken for granted by most.
* Animal Handling - along with familiarity of the forest comes familiarity of it's inhabitants. Elandra has a nearly innate understanding of the forest creatures, including their needs and preoccupations.
* Nature, Perception, and Insight - a highly intelligent individual, Elandra is no stranger to seeing through the false faces of living creatures and into their true intentions. 

==== Connections ====
She is well respected and valued by those of Elderwood City, some of whom are known to do contract work on her behalf. 

She, unbeknownst to many, deals on many occassions with the Eclipsed Order. The EO is able to secure her shipments of valuable alchemy ingredients that are difficult to come by, and can't be found in such quantities without their aid. She justifies this relationship to herself as necessary for her craft
