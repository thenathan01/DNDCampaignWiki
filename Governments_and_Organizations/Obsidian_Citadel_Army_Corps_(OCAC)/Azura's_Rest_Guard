# Azura's Rest Guard (ARG)

## Overview
The **Azura's Rest Guard (ARG)** is a contracted division of the **Obsidian Citadel Army Corps (OCAC)**, stationed in **Azura's Rest** on the Isle of Vespera. While the island lacks a centralized government, the ARG serves as a **joint protective force**, ensuring the safety of Azura's Rest and its critical trade routes. They are seen as **occupiers** by many locals, particularly due to their strict control over the **Vesperian River crossing**, which limits the flow of goods and people between the east and west of the island.

The ARG is commanded by **Commander Thalric "The Quill" Veyne**, a veteran of the OCAC who now oversees the administrative and logistical operations of the Guard. While the ARG reports to the OCAC's **Director of External Operations** in Aranthor, they operate with **significant autonomy** in managing local affairs.

## Quirks and Culture
### The "River Tax"
- The ARG strictly controls passage across the Vesperian River, charging **exorbitant fees** for goods and travelers. This has led to **widespread smuggling** and resentment among locals.

### Old Guard vs. New Blood
- **Veterans** like Thalric resent the younger soldiers who see the ARG as an easy assignment.
- **New recruits** often clash with locals, either by being **overly zealous** or **lazy and corrupt**.

### The Obsidian Killer Legend
- Many ARG soldiers know the stories of the **Obsidian Killer blade**. Some fear it, others want to claim it, and a few suspect **Arlonia** but keep quiet.

### The ARG Tavern
- Soldiers frequent *The Rusty Anchor*, a seedy tavern in Azura's Rest where **deals are made, bribes are paid, and fights break out**. The tavern's owner, a former OCAC quartermaster, knows where all the bodies are buried—literally.

## Potential Plot Hooks
1. **The Smuggler’s Gambit**: A notorious smuggler has been evading Lira for months. The players are hired to catch them—or help them escape.
2. **The Corrupt Enforcer**: Goran frames a merchant for a crime they didn’t commit. The players must clear their name—or blackmail Goran into backing off.
3. **The Obsidian Killer’s Shadow**: A mysterious figure starts killing ARG soldiers with a blade matching the Obsidian Killer’s description. Is it a copycat, a former comrade of Arlonia’s, or Arlonia himself?
4. **The River Blockade**: The ARG shuts down the river crossing entirely, citing "security concerns." The players must find out why—and negotiate or fight their way through.
