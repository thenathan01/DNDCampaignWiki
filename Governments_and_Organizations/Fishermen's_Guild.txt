====== Fishermen's Guild ======
==== Overview ====
The Fishermen's Guild was once a cornerstone of trade and industry, based on the coast in [[Geography and Places:Isle of Vespera:Dawn's Edge|Dawn's Edge]]. Representatives of the guild would speak in [[Geography and Places:Isle of Vespera:Azura's Rest|Azura's Rest]] and contribute to island political decisions, as their contributions weighed significantly on the island economy. 

However, in the last two decades, the fish were less and less abundant, and the guild was eventually disbanded entirely. It's headquarters rests abandoned in Dawn's Edge, now a relic of a forgotten era.

==== History ====
In it's prime, the guild was a powerful entity that managed fishing expeditions, coastal operations, trapping, and even overseeing some sea trade routes. Representatives of the guild, [[NPCs:Elias Old Salt|Old Salt]] among them, were sent on occasion to participate in councils at [[Geography and Places:Isle of Vespera:Azura's Rest|Azura's Rest]].

Beginning around twenty years ago, in the year 2991, a combination of shifting ocean patterns and systematic overfishing led to a gradual decline in the sea life around the isle, crippling the fishing economy and eventually resulting in the abandonment of the guild

==== Current Role ====
Today, the Fishermen's Guild no longer operates, its remnants absorbed by smaller, indpendent fishing operations and families that rely on localized trade and travelling merchants to distribute their goods. 

There are occasional discussions about revitilization efforts in [[Geography and Places:Isle of Vespera:Dawn's Edge|Dawn's Edge]], but recent ocean surveys show that the fish population will likely remain in its current state for many years to come. 

==== Cultural Significance ====
For the people of [[Geography and Places:Isle of Vespera:Dawn's Edge|Dawn's Edge]], the guild once stood as a great source of pride and identity. In many ways, the city was founded and sustained for the past century as a result of the guild's existence. 

Now, the vacant guild headquarters stands as a reminder of better days and lessons learned. The city's population has decreased drastically since those days, and those who remain have found other ways to make a living.
